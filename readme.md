# Responsive Landing Page

## Project Overview

This project is a modern and fully responsive landing page built using only HTML and CSS. It was designed as part of a web development practice assignment to strengthen my understanding of semantic HTML, layout techniques, and custom styling without relying on any frameworks or libraries.

The landing page includes essential UI components such as a navigation bar, hero section, call-to-action blocks, feedback section, and contact form. The layout is designed to be clean, structured, and mobile-friendly.
